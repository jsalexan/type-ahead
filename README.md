  ## Description
  #JavaScript30 - Project #6 - Type Ahead
  <br><br>

  This application uses the following technologies: JavaScript and CSS. There's also a bit of jquery, regex, and we use fetch.
  <br><br>
  This is a form where you type in the city or state you're looking for and a list of auto-suggestions is produced below. Additionally, the text you have entered is highlighted on the list. The list also includes the population number for that city and, using Regex, we add commas to the number. 
  <br><br>
  This was a fun one. Great practice for using fetch, DOM manipulation, and regex. I was disappointed with the result in that once you deleted your text, you were left with the entire list of cities/states suggested. I added in a short bit of code to remedy that. Now when you backspace over or delete your input, there are no suggestions. Much better!

  I thought this exercise was well explained. A few key things: 
  - Adding the spread (...) before data. If you don't use this, every argument pushed to the array is its own item. Using the spread gives you one clean, unnested, array.

  - Nice reminder of regex syntax. g = global and i = insensitive (case)

  -Adding the join allows us to return a string instead of an array with multiple items.

  - In an eventListener, "change" only fires when you go off that input, ie, click outside the input field. Interested in learning more about these variations.
